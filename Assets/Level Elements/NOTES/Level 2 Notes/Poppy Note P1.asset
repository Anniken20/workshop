  text: With all these restless spirits that have been poppin' up, it's been getting
    harder and harder to do my job! I try to fill in a grave and before I can turn
    around, the darn thing is poppin' right back up outta the ground! I've started
    takin' to smackin' them with their own graves before they can fully emerge! Wait
    too long, and it's too late!
