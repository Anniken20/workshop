  text: "Why hello wanderer! \nThis is yer second warning. So you must be insistent
    this is the way yer goin'. Well, I know the tumblin' rocks of this landscape
    better than anyone and it's very easy to step on a loose rock and tumble down
    into the valley below. It's not a pretty fate, trust me. So if you don't want
    that for yerself, see me up ahead and I'll help ya... for a fee.\n- Ross Hawkins"
