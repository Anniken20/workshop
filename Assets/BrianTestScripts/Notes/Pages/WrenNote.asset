  text: So I lost this hey cart a while back and turns out it done drifted all the
    way to that kooky bird man's barn. When I finally got the darned thing back,
    his weird magic infested the damn thing and now it's super strong! There's this
    weird YELLOW GLOW to it and now I can't break it with my bullets unless I build
    up a ton of momentum. I had to RICOCHET my shot like two times just to put a
    dent in it!
